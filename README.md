Hey there 👋

I’m Re'em, a software engineer with a Computer Science degree and hands on experience in DevOps and production systems.

I enjoy building things that actually run in the real world.
From writing code, to automating deployments, to making systems more reliable and easier to operate.

I currently work with production environments, monitoring, and automation, and I’m continuously deepening my DevOps skill set around CI/CD, containers, and cloud infrastructure.

Most of my work focuses on:
- Turning manual processes into automated workflows
- Improving reliability and visibility of running systems
- Learning how large scale systems behave in production

**My main tools these days**
Linux, Docker, Git, GitHub Actions, AWS  
Python, Bash, JavaScript  
Monitoring, logs, metrics, and alerts

I’ve pinned a few projects below that represent how I think and what I build, with more DevOps focused labs coming soon.
