### Hey there! <img src="https://emojis.slackmojis.com/emojis/images/1536351075/4594/blob-wave.gif" width="25"/>

I’m **Re'em**, a software engineer with a Computer Science degree and hands on experience in DevOps and production systems.

I like building things that actually run in the real world.

From writing code, to automating deployments, to keeping systems stable and observable.

I currently work with production environments, monitoring, and automation, and I’m actively growing into a DevOps focused role.

My main tools these days are Linux, Docker, Git, GitHub Actions, and AWS.  
I mostly code in Python, Bash, and JavaScript, and spend a lot of time with logs, metrics, and alerts.

I’ve pinned a few projects below that reflect how I think and what I build, with more DevOps focused labs coming soon.

* I enjoy turning messy systems into clean, automated ones
* **Hobbies:** gym, learning new tech, building things
